the machines pile into
the machines plod off
twilight hours ooze into joints
the machines get checkups
the machines believe

wretched management
entity resources
we drove from the Greek coast
all night under stars!
the bombs were not real,
they were never real
it said, over and over
from lips of tire and road.

the machines direct us
the machines stare through
wake under tears streaming
the machines knew it all
the machines knew it all.
