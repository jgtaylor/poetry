In the crook of stairwells
under the last window unbroken
confessions of love & hate
to uncertainty's black depths...

Where are the wild dogs?

Winter's flowers bloom in fields
abandoned to the decay of industry,
so many minds of their generation
understandably sold themselves
for a comfortable retirement,
while we have put bullets
in hours.

Will we see the wild dogs?

The children's disappointments
are the planks in our own eyes!
While we talk of splinters,
desperately helping everything die...

the wild dogs came last night,
as you lay sleeping -
salivating and howling and growling
the low grumble of distrust & shame.
I watched them scamper off
with my limbs & kidneys.

Now I must tell you of their coats,
such majesty and flamboyance!
they wore fire, had tails of ice
and their teeth! My God! Their teeth!
great pyramids dripping from their jaws,
and how they glided over winter's feet:
virgins in translucent silk night gowns.

Oh! How could you have slept through
such discordant ecstasy?!
Well, I saw the wild dogs
and we can finally go now.
