Gotta be loud in the morning,
James Brown loud!
I'm Back! PayBack!
Nightmares & Dreams,
I got James Brown on my side!
running down streets
without end -
well,

You Gotta Get Ready for the Big Payback!

can't sleep all night,
those eyes dismembering me,
drooling teeth and garlic breath -
I've got James Brown in the A.M.!

Don't do me no darn favor!
I don't know karate
but I know cuh-ray-ze!

Can't move my shoulder,
hands broken off at the wrist.
but James Brown in the morning, Loud!
beasts of spirit go for the hills
of memory, of defeat & capitulation.

you'll never kill the rooster.
